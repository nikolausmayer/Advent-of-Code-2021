I honestly have no idea how to solve this day in code.

I banged my head against several walls, then went back to drafting the program flow on paper. This strategy served me well on previous AoC emulation-style tasks, so...

...it worked. It took a while, but I was able to wrap my head around what the program does and how the individual digits' blocks interconnect, and which instructions are unreachable and thus meaningless, and finally which pairs of blocks impose which constraints on the solution.

This task is amazing and I **hate** it because I want to *code* but could not hack my way out of this day if my life depended on it. On the other hand, maybe I really should check out that TIS-100 game...
