This day is up there with the best of AoC for me. It requires *some* algorithmic thinking but offers a lot of freedom in the specifics. Part 2 is conceptually straightforward, but the actual workload depends on how part 1 was solved. Runtimes are nontrivial for the larger tasks, but still suitable for fast solution iterations.
