I'm honestly not quite sure what the intended solution for this day is. I ended up doing a full trajectory simulation for day 1, with some generous heuristic bounds on possible starting values. It felt like over-engineering but I did not want to resolve a position integral.. and luckily so, as part 2 was just a trivial change for me.
I should probably take a look at some other solutions for this one.
