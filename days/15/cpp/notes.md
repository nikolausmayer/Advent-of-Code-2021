A-star cannot be missing from AoC!

Part 2 initially scared me because I already had a nontrivial computation time for part 1 and I have been permanently scarred by an older AoC task (a maze with keys and doors) which stumped me and my inefficient for *months*.

Luckily, a simple extension to how I keep track of which states are worth expanding improved my runtime so much that part 2 became fast again.
