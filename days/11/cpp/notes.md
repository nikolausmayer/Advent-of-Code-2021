Part 1 was a neat little exercise in "how do I store this data such that I don't have to overwrite everything all the time but also such that I don't need 12 extra data structures".

Part 2 was easy enough to be a little disappointing. I remembered a problem with synchronizing bus stops (or something along those lines) from the 2020 AoC which received some criticism for being too difficult, but I hoped this task would be along those lines. Alas, it is trivial to brute-force!
