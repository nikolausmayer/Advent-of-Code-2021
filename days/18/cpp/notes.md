My brain hurts.

This is a very *simple* day in terms of how much CS one should know, but it's just *so many corners to wrap your brain around*! The right data structure (**definitely** not mine) makes it easier, but other than that the hardest part is the graph-traversal element in the "explode" rule.

Part 1 took me a long time and I was very relieved to find that part 2 can be brute-forced.
